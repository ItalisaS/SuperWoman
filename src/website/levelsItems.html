<h1>WordHunting</h1>

<p> The category WordHunting has the aim to find the correct word to a shown picture.<br>

At the beginning of a level you will see a picture of an item and during the level you will have to collect the fitting letters to complete the word. <br>

You need to find the correct letters until the time has run out.
If you win, the next level will be unlocked - if not, you'll have to replay the level.<br>

Good luck and have fun!</p>
