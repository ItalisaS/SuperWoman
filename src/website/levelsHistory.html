<h1>History</h1>

<p> The category History has the aim to find the correct word to a shown picture or question.<br>

At the beginning of a level you will either see a picture of a historical person or you will get a question which you will have to answer. 
During the level you will have to collect the fitting symbols to find the corresponding name or numbers.<br>

You need to find the correct symbols until the time has run out.
If you win, the next level will be unlocked - if not, you'll have to replay the level. <br>

Good luck and have fun! </p>
