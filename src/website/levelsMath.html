<h1>Math</h1>

<p> The category Math has the aim to solve arithmetic problems. <br>

At the beginning of a level you will see a equation and during the level you will have to collect the fitting numbers to solve the equation. <br>

You need to find the correct numbers until the time has run out.
If you win, the next level will be unlocked - if not, you'll have to replay the level.<br>

Good luck and have fun!</p>
